# Radio-Silence
Radio Silence is a 3D Horror Game placing you, a researcher experimenting with things you probably shouldn't have tampered with, inside a lab with your very own creations. Try to move quietly through the levels to dear freedom... although be careful, your creations have ears.

You'll need to unzip Radio Silence_Data as it was too big to upload to Github directly.
